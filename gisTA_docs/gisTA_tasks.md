## GIS Tasks within Center for Spatial Research assistantship  

### Overview
Your responsibilities include providing assistance to GSAPP students and faculty in finding and using GIS data and software.

The position requires a strong familiarity with the GIS data and GIS software. You are not expected to be an expert, but you should be able to assist with the most common tasks performed in GIS at GSAPP as well as be able to find and provide references for tasks and functions you are less familiar with.

The workload for the position varies throughout the semester, and you will have to find a balance between the short-term and long-term tasks. Following midterms, most students have completed their analytical work, so the need for GIS help diminishes.


### Write and update GIS tutorials
* Create text documents (.md) of tutorials as a text document
* Create a folder for images and key images within master folder
* Include description before tutorials explaining what the tutorial will accomplish
* Include key image and description to be used on C4SR website
* Push to Github [tutorial repository](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/gis_tutorials) and create entry in C4SR site
